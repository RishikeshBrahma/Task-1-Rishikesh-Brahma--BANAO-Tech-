Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines aspects of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise.

The Data Science Lifecycle typically includes:

Data Collection: Gathering raw data from various sources.

Data Cleaning: Removing errors and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using charts and statistics to find patterns.

Model Building: Using Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest to make predictions.
